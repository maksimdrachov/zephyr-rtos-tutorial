## Zephyr Tutorial Introduction

*Why have I started writing this tutorial?*
When I started learning Zephyr (~June 2021) I noticed it was difficult to find a clear and comprehensive guide for n00bs like myself. As I was learning I made a Gihub repository with personal notes and useful links. Eventually I decided to write a comprehensive tutorial - to give back to the opensource community and to help others that might want to learn Zephyr. 

*Why on Github?*
As Zephyr is a relatively new project and still very much evolving, I thought it made sense to write this tutorial in an open source manner. Therefore as things change, and the project evolves, it will remain possible to keep the information up-to-date. If you come across any code that is not working, information that is invalid (or out-of-date),... don't hesitate to raise an issue or submit a PR. I hope that with the help of the Zephyr community this can become an entry-point for all beginners.
