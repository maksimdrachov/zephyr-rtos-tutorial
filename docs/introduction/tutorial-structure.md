# Tutorial structure

## How is the tutorial structured?

- Each lesson covers 1 aspect of Zephyr
- The order of the lessons is choosen deliberately, it is recommended to not skip ahead (unless you already know a thing or two, then skip ahead!)

Each lesson has 4 parts:
- Introduction: here we'll introduce each new topic, explain why it is useful.
- Commands: here we'll go over all the commands/api calls that are relevant to that particular topic.
- Kconfig: here we take a look at the different Kconfig settings that might be interesting.
- Exercises: this will contain some small exercises to test your understanding. If you're able to complete them, you've mastered this lesson and can go on to the next one. (Don't worry solutions are provided)
