# Prerequisites

## 1. [Nucleo L552ZE-Q](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l552ze-q.html)

This is the board that I'll be using for the tutorial, since Zephyr is platform-agnostic you can also use whatever you have laying around, but the build commands will look slightly different for you. I can recommend picking an STM32 or Nordic board as those usually are the best supported (full RPI Pico support is still [pending](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/34835)).

[Zephyr supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#boards)

## 2. [USB to Micro-USB Cable](https://www.google.com/search?q=micro+usb)

This allows you to connect you (Nucleo) board through the debugger to your computer.

## 3. Optional

To play with some of the more advanced features, you'll need a board that supports this.

- Ethernet: [Nucleo F756ZG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f756zg.html))
