# Prerequisites

## 1. [NUCLEO-F756ZG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f756zg.html)
This is the board that we'll be using for the tutorial, since Zephyr is platform-agnostic you can also use whatever you have laying around, but the commands might look slitghtly different for you.

[Zephyr supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#boards)

## 2. [USB to Micro-USB Cable](https://www.google.com/search?q=micro+usb)
This allows you to connect you Nucleo board through the debugger to your computer.

## 3. [Ethernet Cable](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethernet)
If you want to learn about networking you'll need an ethernet cable and an ethernet port on your computer (or have access to the router).
