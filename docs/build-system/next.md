# What's next? 

Now that you've hopefully become somewhat acquainted to the way Zephyr works it is really up to you to decide how this journey continues. In this final section I would like to give you some pointers as to how you might continue growing your skills:

- Study/contribute to some open-source projects that use Zephyr:
    - [Zephyr Led Driver Library](https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-led-driver)
    
    This is one of my projects. I'm trying to build a library to control different kinds of LED drivers using an STM32 running Zephyr. A good place to start if you're unsure: pick a LED driver that's not supported yet, download the datasheet and start struggling/coding!
    - [PineTime smartwatch](https://github.com/endian-albin/pinetime-hypnos)
    - [zmk: mechanical keyboard firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk)
    - [Anyl: Embedded crypto wallet (for IoT)](https://github.com/Anylsite/anyl-wallet)
    - [Golioth: IoT cloud platform](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr-sdk)
    - [Battery management system](https://github.com/scttnlsn/bms)
    - [MG100: IoT sensor module](https://github.com/LairdCP/MG100_firmware)
    - [BLE sensor](https://github.com/patrickmoffitt/zephyr_ble_sensor)
    - [UWB position tracking](https://github.com/RT-LOC/zephyr-dwm1001)
    - [air quality sensor](https://github.com/ExploratoryEngineering/air-quality-sensor-node)
- Delve into some of the more 'advanced' features using the [wiki](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/)
- Try to build something yourself? (Best one!)
- In a couple of years I might write a book on Zephyr so; stay tuned for that one!
