## How do I define threads in Zephyr?

A thread is spawned by defining its stack area and its thread control block, and then calling k_thread_create().

The stack area must be defined using K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE or K_KERNEL_STACK_DEFINE to ensure it is properly set up in memory.

The thread spawning function returns its thread id, which can be used to reference the thread.

```c
#define MY_STACK_SIZE 500
#define MY_PRIORITY 5

extern void my_entry_point(void *, void *, void *);

K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE(my_stack_area, MY_STACK_SIZE);
struct k_thread my_thread_data;

k_tid_t my_tid = k_thread_create(&my_thread_data, my_stack_area,
                                 K_THREAD_STACK_SIZEOF(my_stack_area),
                                 my_entry_point,
                                 NULL, NULL, NULL,
                                 MY_PRIORITY, 0, K_NO_WAIT);
```

In order to define a thread you'll need to initiate some parameters:

```c
k_tid_t k_thread_create(struct k_thread *new_thread, k_thread_stack_t *stack, size_t stack_size, k_thread_entry_t entry, void *p1, void *p2, void *p3, int prio, uint32_t options, k_timeout_t delay)

```
Parameters:
- `new_thread` – Pointer to uninitialized struct k_thread
- `stack` – Pointer to the stack space.
- `stack_size` – Stack size in bytes.
- `entry` – Thread entry function.
- `p1` – 1st entry point parameter.
- `p2` – 2nd entry point parameter.
- `p3` – 3rd entry point parameter.
- `prio` – Thread priority.
- `options` – Thread options.
- `delay` – Scheduling delay, or K_NO_WAIT (for no delay).

Returns:
- ID of new thread.

Alternatively, a thread can be declared at compile time by calling K_THREAD_DEFINE. Observe that the macro defines the stack area, control block, and thread id variables automatically.

The following code has the same effect as the code segment above.
```c
#define MY_STACK_SIZE 500
#define MY_PRIORITY 5

extern void my_entry_point(void *, void *, void *);

K_THREAD_DEFINE(my_tid, MY_STACK_SIZE,
                my_entry_point, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                MY_PRIORITY, 0, 0);
```

## Thread commands
### k_thread_start()
A thread must be created before it can be used.

### k_thread_abort()
Abort a thread. Thread is taken off all kernel queues.

![k_thread_im](/svg-images/threads/thread-abort.png)

### k_sleep()
A thread can prevent itself from executing for a specified amount of time. A sleeping thread becomes executable automatically once the time limit is reached.

### k_thread_suspend()
Prevent a thread from executing for an indefinite period of time. Once suspended, use k_thread_resume() to re-start.

![k_thread_im](/svg-images/threads/thread-suspend.png)

### k_thread_join()
Sleep until a thread exits. 

For example:
- thread_b is responsible for setting up a hardware interface
- thread_a is responsible for processing data from this interface
- As long as thread_b has not exited, thread_a can't start, so we'll use k_thread_join(thread_b, timeout) in this case.
