| Command                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| k_timer_init            | Initialize a timer. This routine initializes a timer, prior to its first use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| k_timer_start           | Start a timer. This routine starts a timer, and resets its status to zero. The timer begins counting down using the specified duration and period values.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| k_timer_stop            | Stop a timer. This routine stops a running timer prematurely. The timer’s stop function, if one exists, is invoked by the caller.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| k_timer_status_get      | Read timer status. This routine reads the timer’s status, which indicates the number of times it has expired since its status was last read.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| k_timer_status_sync     | Synchronize thread to timer expiration. This routine blocks the calling thread until the timer’s status is non-zero (indicating that it has expired at least once since it was last examined) or the timer is stopped. If the timer status is already non-zero, or the timer is already stopped, the caller continues without waiting. |
| k_timer_expires_ticks   | Get next expiration time of a timer, in system ticks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| k_timer_remaining_ticks | Get time remaining before a timer next expires, in system ticks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| k_timer_remaining_get   | Get time remaining before a timer next expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
