# Zephyr: Tutorial for Beginners

This repository contains a step-by-step guide that teaches you how to use Zephyr RTOS. It assumes:
- no previous experience with RTOS
- basic embedded electronics knowledge (GPIO, Timers, Interrupt,...)
- knowledge of C

Each lesson builds on the previous one. Most lessons end with exercises (with solutions!) that allow you to test your knowledge to make sure you understand everything that is covered.
